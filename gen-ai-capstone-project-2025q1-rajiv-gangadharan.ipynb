Customer support agents often deal with a wide range of queries, from basic troubleshooting steps to more complex hardware and software problems. Access to well-structured and easily searchable support documentation is essential for agents to quickly diagnose and resolve customer issues.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem Outline\n\nTraditional methods of accessing support documentation can be time-consuming.

A synthetic PDF file containing common desktop and laptop troubleshooting steps, structured into logical sections (e.g., power issues, display problems, network connectivity, battery issues). This document serves as the knowledge base for the AI assistant.\n\n## Generative AI Model\n\nA Large Language Model (LLM), _command-r-plus_ from _COHERE_ This model will be used to understand user queries and extract relevant information from the support documentation.\n\n## Embedding Model\n\nThe embedding model used is _embed-english-light-v3.0_ also from _COHERE_. \n\n## Vector Store\n\nI have used chromadb in this case. \n\n## LangChain and Langgraph Framework\n\nThe LangChain library was used as the framework to connect the LLM with the support documentation. This involved techniques like:\n\n* Document Loading: Loading and processing the PDF file.\n* Text Splitting: Dividing the document into smaller chunks for efficient retrieval.\n* Vector Embeddings: Creating vector representations of the text chunks to enable semantic search.\n* Retrieval-Based Question Answering: Using a retrieval mechanism (e.g., a vector store and similarity search) to find relevant sections in the documentation based on the agent's query.\n* Response Generation: Utilizing the LLM to generate concise and helpful answers or troubleshooting steps based on the retrieved information.\n\nFor the agent creation and operation, LangGraph was used.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

Restart your computer: This often resolves temporary software glitches that could be causing the mouse issue. \n\n2. Check error messages: Note down any error messages displayed related to your mouse or USB devices for further investigation. \n\n3. Gather information: Think about when the problem started and any recent changes or installations made to your system. \n\n4. Try a different USB port: Connect your mouse to a different USB port to ensure the issue isn't specific to one particular port. \n\n5. Try a different mouse: If possible, test with a known working mouse to determine if the issue is with the mouse itself or your computer's USB ports/drivers. \n\n6. Update USB drivers: Check for any updates for your USB drivers and install them. \n\n7.
