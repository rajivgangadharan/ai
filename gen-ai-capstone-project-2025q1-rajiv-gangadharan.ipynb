upon a time, there was a curious cat named Whiskers. He lived in a cozy house with his owner, Mrs. Smith, who loved him dearly. Whiskers was always curious about the world around him and loved to explore and discover new things.\n\nOne sunny day, Whiskers was taking a nap on the warm windowsill when he suddenly heard a strange sound coming from the garden. Intrigued, he jumped down from his perch and cautiously made his way outside. He found himself in a lush garden filled with colorful flowers and buzzing bees.\n\nWhiskers began to explore, sniffing at the flowers and chasing after butterflies. As he wandered further, he came across a small hole under a bush. Curious as always, he stuck his head inside and found himself in a dark, narrow tunnel. Without hesitation, he crawled in, determined to uncover the mystery that lay ahead.\n\nThe tunnel twisted and turned, leading Whiskers deeper into the unknown. Soon, he could no longer see the entrance, and he found himself in a spacious chamber lit by a faint glow. To his surprise, he discovered a hidden treasure trove filled with sparkling gems and golden coins.\n\nWhiskers was amazed by the sight, and his curiosity got the better of him once again. He began to play with the shiny objects, batting at the gems and chasing the rolling coins. As he did so, he accidentally knocked over a pile of coins, creating a loud clatter that echoed through the chamber.\n\nSuddenly, a deep voice boomed through the room, \"Who dares disturb my treasure?\" Whiskers froze in his tracks as a giant, furry creature emerged from the shadows. It was a friendly bear who had been guarding the treasure for years.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I was just curious,\" Whiskers meowed, feeling a little scared.\n\nThe bear chuckled, \"There's no need to be sorry, little cat. I haven't had any visitors down here in a long time. I'm just glad someone finally found my treasure.\"\n\nWhiskers and the bear ended up spending the afternoon together, playing with the treasure and sharing stories. The bear told Whiskers about how he had collected the treasure over the years and was happy to finally have someone to share it with.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Whiskers bid farewell to the bear and made his way back through the tunnel. He returned home to Mrs. Smith, eager to tell her about his amazing adventure and the wonderful friend he had made.\n\nFrom that day on, Whiskers continued to explore the world with his curious nature, always seeking new adventures and making unexpected friends along the way. And the bear, grateful for the company, continued to guard his treasure, knowing that sometimes the greatest treasures are the friends we make.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip uninstall -y ypy-websocket\n!pip install langchain-core \"langgraph>0.2.27\" \n!pip install -Uq
