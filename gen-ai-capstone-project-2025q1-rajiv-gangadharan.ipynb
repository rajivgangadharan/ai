    "\n",
    "In today's oganizations, providing efficient and effective customer support for technical issues related to desktops and laptops is crucial. Customer support agents often deal with a wide range of queries, from basic troubleshooting steps to more complex hardware and software problems. Access to well-structured and easily searchable support documentation is essential for agents to quickly diagnose and resolve customer issues.\n"

    "\n",
    "Traditional methods of accessing support documentation can be time-consuming. Agents may need to navigate through lengthy PDF files or knowledge base articles to find the relevant information. This can lead to longer resolution times, increased frustration for both agents and customers, and potentially lower customer satisfaction."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to leverage the power of Generative AI to create an intelligent assistant that can enhance the capabilities of customer support agents dealing with desktop and laptop issues. The core idea is to process existing support documentation (in this case, a synthetic PDF file created for this purpose) and enable agents to quickly retrieve relevant information and potentially generate helpful responses or troubleshooting steps based on customer queries."

    "# Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the primary dataset. A synthetic PDF file containing common desktop and laptop troubleshooting steps, structured into logical sections (e.g., power issues, display problems, network connectivity, battery issues). This document serves as the knowledge base for the AI assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generative AI Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A Large Language Model (LLM), _command-r-plus_ from _COHERE_ This model will be used to understand user queries and extract relevant information from the support documentation.\n",

    "## Embedding Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding model used is _embed-english-light-v3.0_ also from _COHERE_. \n",

    "I have used chromadb in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "## LangChain and Langgraph Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain library was used as the framework to connect the LLM with the support documentation. This involved techniques like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Document Loading: Loading and processing the PDF file.\n",
    "* Text Splitting: Dividing the document into smaller chunks for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "* Vector Embeddings: Creating vector representations of the text chunks to enable semantic search.\n",
    "* Retrieval-Based Question Answering: Using a retrieval mechanism (e.g., a vector store and similarity search) to find relevant sections in the documentation based on the agent's query.\n",
    "* Response Generation: Utilizing the LLM to generate concise and helpful answers or troubleshooting steps based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the agent creation and operation, LangGraph was used."
